Please find below more details on these functionalities, which have been implemented in this application:  

## 1. Generate Site Collection Report (PPE Only) ##
This operation generates a text file containing a list of all site collections found across all web applications in the target farm.  
 
This functionality does not use any input file and generates result in output text format. If at any time the details/report of all the Site Collection of any farm are required, using this functionality will give the desired output - ***GenerateSiteCollectionReport-yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.txt*** (verbose log file).


## 2. Generate Non-Default Master Page Usage Report ##
This operation reads a list of site collection URLs from an input file and scans each site collection, looking for any web that is using a non-default SP2013 Master Page (i.e., something other than “seattle.master”) as either its System or Site master page.  

This functionality reads an input file (Sites.txt), which contains a fully-qualified, absolute site collection URL. Generates result in output file - ***GenerateNonDefaultMasterPageUsageReport -yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.log*** (verbose log file).


## 3. Generate Site Column & Content Type Usage Report ##

It also looks for local Content Types that have been derived from the custom Content Types of interest.  

This report is helpful in trying to remediate the Missing Content Type and Missing Site Column reports.  This report tells you where within each site collection that the content types and site columns are ***still in use***.  

This functionality reads an input file (Sites.txt, SiteColumns.csv and ContentTypes.csv). Generates result in output file - ***GenerateColumnAndTypeUsageReport-yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.log*** (verbose log file).


## 4. Delete Missing Setup Files ##
This operation reads a list of setup file definitions from an input file and deletes the associated setup file from the target SharePoint environment.  

This operation is helpful in trying to remediate the Missing Setup Files reports.  It attempts to remove all specified setup files from the target SharePoint environment.

Generates result in output file - ***DeleteMissingSetupFiles-yyyyMMdd_hhmmss.log*** (verbose log file).


## 5. Delete Missing Features ##
This operation reads a list of feature definitions from an input file and deletes the associated feature from the webs and sites of the target SharePoint environment.
